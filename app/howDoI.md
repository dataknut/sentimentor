### Blame someone?

The Sentimentor is brought to you by [@dataknut](https://twitter.com/dataknut),[@energySoton](https://twitter.com/energysoton) and [@UoSEngineering](https://twitter.com/UoSEngineering). It is based on an idea by [@draccoops](https://twitter.com/draccoops) and made possible by [@juliasilge](https://twitter.com/juliasilge) and [@drob](https://twitter.com/drob)'s #rstats [#tidytext](https://juliasilge.github.io/tidytext/) package.

### Check the results are 'right'?

Tricky one. We think the calculations are 'right' given the inputs (your typing and the sentiment data).

If you really really think they're wrong, please raise an issue on the code [repo](https://github.com/dataknut/Sentimentor/issues?q=is%3Aissue).

### Spread the word?

Twitter is our viral medium of choice. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/sentimentor">Tweet #sentimentor</a>

### Check the data sources?

'Bing' sentiment data is sourced from [Bing Liu and collaborators](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/FBS/sentiment-analysis.html). 
Stop words are derived from the #rstats [tidytext package](https://github.com/juliasilge/tidytext), [stop_words](https://rdrr.io/cran/tidytext/man/stop_words.html) data.
