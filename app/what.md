**The Sentimentor**:

 * automatically filters out the 'stopping' words (the/and/if etc);
 * assigns a positive/negative sentiment to the words that, according to the [Bing lexicon](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/FBS/sentiment-analysis.html), have positive or negative sentiment;
 * counts how many of each sentiment you have per line and plots the result by line number.
 
 You may find you have multiple negative and/or positive words (or no sentimented words at all) per line.
 
 If you don't see the plot check you have used some non-stopping words.
